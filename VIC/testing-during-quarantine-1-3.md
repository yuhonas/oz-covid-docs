# Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing during mandatory quarantine

This information is for returned international travellers undertaking 14-day mandatory quarantine. All returned travellers are being asked to complete voluntary testing for coronavirus (COVID-19) on approximately day 3 and day 11 of mandatory quarantine

## Why am I being asked to get a test if I donâ€™t have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms?

The Department of Health and Human Services has rolled outan enhanced testing program to better understand
how coronavirus (COVID-19) might be spreading in the community. Because retumed travellers are still one of the higher risk groups for coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, those in mandatory quarantine are encouraged to get tested before the 14-day period concludes. Testing will be available on day 3 and day 11 of quarantine

There is a small chance that you could have coronavirus (COVID-19) even though you feel well and may not have any symptoms

The results of this enhanced testing, including testing those about to come out of mandatory quarantine, will help us respond to any spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

## Why is expanded testing important?

The more testing we do, the more data we have about the prevalence of coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community. Because returned travellers are still one of the higher risk groups for coronavirus (COVID-19) infection,
those in mandatory quarantine are encouraged to get tested prior to their discharge.

## Who is being asked to get a test?

Everyone in mandatory quarantine (who has not already been diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19)) is being asked to get tested during the quarantine period. This is voluntary.

## What do I need to do?

You will be asked to answer some brief questions, including checking whether you have any specific symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), no matter how mild, such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, runny nose or loss of sense of smell. Even if you do not have any symptoms you will still be offered testing.

You will be asked to give your verbal consent to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19)

## What should I expect from the test?

Teams of nurses will be going from room to room performing the tests. They will take your temperature and ask about symptoms. Nurses will be wearing full personal protective equipment and will perform the test on you at the door. The test is a swab of the back of your nose and throat and takes about one minute.

## What should I do while I am waiting for the test results?

You will remain in mandatory quarantine until day 14 of your quarantine period.
