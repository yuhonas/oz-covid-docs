### Advice notice

## Advice for all arrivals in Melbourne

### A 14-day quarantine period is compulsory

Passengers arriving from overseas

are required by law to enter compulsory quarantine for 14 days to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19)

Once you have collected your baggage and cleared passport and custom control, you will be transported to
accommodation provided by the government, where you will be required to spend 14-days in quarantine

The government will cover the cost of accommodation and essentials during this period.

This requirement applies to passengers arriving from all countries. This includes Victorians returning home and
transiting passengers

An officer from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will assist you in the arrivals area and
arrange transport to your accommodation.

You will be transported directly from the airport to your allocated accommodation where you Lnust remain
quarantined for 14 days

You must not leave the accommodation, unless there is an emergency situation, or you have been granted
permission to leave because

* you need to attend a medical facility to receive medical care
* it is reasonably necessary for your physical and mental health
* there are compassionate grounds.

All returned travellers are being asked to complete voluntary testing for coronavirus (COVID-1 9) on approximately
day 11â€”12 of mandatory quarantine.

You must not let another person enter the premises, unless they are authorised to be there for a specific purpose
such as providing food, medical care or a welfare check.

If you have a disability, please advise the DHHS officer of any special needs you may have. If you are travelling
with, or being met by a carer, that carer must remain with you in quarantine for the 14-day period.

If you wish to book a flight out of Australia, you will still be required to enter quarantine until your departure.

For unaccompanied minors only:

* if your home is in another state (not Victoria or Queensland) and you are booked on a connecting flight, you
may board your connecting flight to your home state. Once there, you will be quarantined under that state's
direction.

* if your home state is Victoria, your parent or guardian can accompany you into quarantine, provided they
agree to stay there with you ur same conditions for the 14-day period.


A person who fails to comply with this requirement will be liable to fines of up to approximately A$20,000.
