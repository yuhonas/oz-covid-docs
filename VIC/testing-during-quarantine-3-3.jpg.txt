## What if I am a ‘close contact' but have completed my 14 days?

If you share a room with someone who tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), you will be considered a 'close
contact' of a confirmed case. You will be required to isolate for 14 days from the time of last contact with the case
This means that you may need to continue self-isolating at home (or in a hotel) after your mandatory quarantine period ends

If you live in Victoria you will be able to finish your self isolation period at home, if you can isolate safely and
appropriately at your home If you cannot isolate at home, we will assist you to arrange appropriate accommodation
until you have completed the 14-day isolation period

You cannot catch a flight or travel interstate until you have been cleared by the Department of Health and Human
Services

## What if someone in my room tests positive but we don’t want to be separated?

If you are sharing a room with someone who tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), you will be recommended
to isolate in separate rooms. This is because you are still at risk of becoming infected while your roommate is
infectious Besides the risk of infection, it will also prolong the length of time you are required to quarantine.

If you isolate in separate rooms following the diagnosis, your 14-day quarantine period will start from the last time
of contact with the confirmed case. If you choose to continue to share a room, your 14-day quarantine period will
start from the time the person who is a confirmed case meets the clinical criteria for release from isolation, as per
the department’s guidelines.

## Can I take a flight if I am a close contact or confirmed case?

If you are a close contact who is still within their 14-day quarantine period, or a confirmed case who has not yet met
the department’s criteria for release from isolation, you cannot catch a flight to travel either domestically or
internationally.
