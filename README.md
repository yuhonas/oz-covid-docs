# OZ COVID-19 Docs

This is a repository for various documentation received throughout the COVID quarantine program for International travellers arriving in Australia

## Why?

1. This information should be public, I haven't been able too at the time of writing reconcile it online at dhhs.vic.gov.au or similiar sites, New Zealand seems to have a single public [Welcome Pack](https://covid19.govt.nz/assets/resources/miq-travellers/mif_welcome-pack.pdf)
2. So we can compare our response to other states/countries, this is a great opportunity to learn from each other during
   this unprecedented time
3. For posterity
